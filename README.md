# satellite_image_understanding

Adapted from the works of segnet for remote sensing image processing, in the Beyond RGB paper [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01636145/document]. We implemented the new addition of the context encoding module using SegNet as the backbone feature 
extractor. The ISPRS Vaihingen dataset is publicly available online. 

Dependencies are stored in the env.yml. A simple pip install will fill in any other missing python libraries. PyTorch >= 0.4
