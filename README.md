# satellite_image_understanding

Adapted from the works of segnet for remote sensing image processing, in the Beyond RGB paper [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01636145/document]. We implemented the new addition of the context encoding module using SegNet as the backbone feature 
extractor. The ISPRS Vaihingen dataset is publicly available online. 

Env.yml containing the relevant dependendencies coming soon.

Details on how to run the notebook coming soon.

*White paper explaining the thought process, and detailing the results is attached (.pdf)*
